Hi! I'm Nancy, and I'm really fascinated with data forensics, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity. Despite the fact that I am only at the beginning and still have a lot to learn, I am really passionate about these subjects and can't wait to delve further. Come along with me on this educational adventure, I hope you will. With me, it's always "she/her." Send me an email if you need to communicate with me. Interesting thing about me: I enjoy trying food from all around the world.
